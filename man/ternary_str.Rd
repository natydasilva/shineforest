\title{Data structure with the  projected and boundary by node and class.}
\usage{
ternary_str(ppf, id, sp, dx, dy)
}
\arguments{
\item{ppf}{is a PPforest object}

\item{id}{is a vector with the selected projection directions}

\item{sp}{is the simplex dimensions, if k is the number of classes sp = k - 1}

\item{dx}{first direction included in id}

\item{dy}{second direction included in id}
}
\value{
Data frame needed to visualize a ternary plot
}
